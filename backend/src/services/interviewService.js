      "difficulty": "<easy/medium/hard>",
      "source": "<resume/general>"
    }
  ]
}

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. Generate a balanced mix of questions:
   - About 40% should be "resume-based" questions that directly reference the candidate's specific projects, skills, technologies, or experiences from their resume
   - About 60% should be "general" questions for the ${jobRole} role in ${industry}
2. For resume-based questions, specifically mention projects, technologies, or experiences from the resume
3. Progress from easy to hard difficulty
4. Include behavioral, technical, and situational questions
5. Adjust complexity for ${experienceLevel} level
6. Make questions feel personal and tailored to this specific candidate
7. Generate exactly ${questionCount} questions

Examples of good resume-based questions:
- "I see you worked on [specific project from resume]. Can you walk me through the architecture decisions you made?"
- "You mentioned experience with [specific technology]. How did you handle [common challenge]?"
- "Tell me about a challenge you faced at [company from resume] and how you resolved it."`;

      "type": "<behavioral/technical/situational/general>",

    }
  ]
}

Rules:
1. Mix question types appropriately (behavioral, technical, situational, general)
2. Progress from easy to hard
3. Make questions specific to ${jobRole} role
4. Include industry-specific scenarios for ${industry}
5. Adjust complexity for ${experienceLevel} level

    "words": ["<filler word 1>", "<filler word 2>"]
  },
  "keyTakeaway": "<One sentence summary of the most important thing to improve for next time>"

CRITICAL RULES:
1. Be professional, specific, and actionable - avoid generic feedback
2. The idealAnswer should be a complete example answer, not just tips
3. Identify concrete strengths and gaps in the response
4. For whatWasMissing, focus on content gaps, not delivery
5. Detect filler words: "um", "uh", "like", "you know", "basically", "actually", "so", "I mean"
6. Score fairly: 90+ = exceptional, 70-89 = good, 50-69 = needs work, <50 = significant gaps`;
